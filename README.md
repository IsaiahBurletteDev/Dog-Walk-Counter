# Dog-Walk-Counter
This is a dog walking counter application. You can track what time and which dog you chose to walk.

In the near future I will add the feature to be able to add your own dogs. This app is currently only availiable for iPhone. Soon it will be availiable for android.

I gained the inspiration to create this app when my brother and I are constantly arguing about whose turn it is to walk the dog. With this app you are able to log when you take a dog out and display the time for each individual walk.
